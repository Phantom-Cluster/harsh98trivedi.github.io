My life started in a lovely city, &lt;strong&gt;Kanpur&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(formerly Cawnpore)&lt;/em&gt;,  the 11th most populous urban city located in the central part of &lt;strong&gt;Uttar Pradesh, India&lt;/strong&gt;. I love Graphic Designing, Web Development, Video Editing, Travelling, Learning new things and Making new friends with similar interest and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer&lt;/em&gt;, is my most favorite subject since childhood, has completely changed the way I think and understand things, the best part about a computer is the learning experience, whether you are designing some stuff, editing a video or programming an app, if you are doing all that with a goal in mind and with full dedication, you‚Äôll surely learn how things work and how you need to work with them or tweak them in your own possible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am starting this &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; based blog to share my thoughts, experiences, knowledge, and much more, I will share most of my social activities now and then, also I will be sharing some apps, websites, and tools that I have made or I am using for making my tech activities easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently live in Kanpur, where people are mostly boring, but exceptions are always there so I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://kanpurfoss.org&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KanpurFOSS Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Kanpur&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;meetups&lt;/a&gt;, workshops, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kanpur.wordcamp.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WordCamp&lt;/a&gt; every year, I would like to thank KanpurFOSS Community for sharing an awesome tech experience here, in Kanpur.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more &lt;a href=&quot;/#about-section&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; me, you can simply &lt;a href=&quot;/#contact-section&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; me using different social media platforms mentioned in the navbar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also be sharing some of the Tweets, Facebook Posts, Instagram photos and YouTube videos using a simple embed or using some sort of API.
